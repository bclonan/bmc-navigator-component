# Your Town Finance Design System

A comprehensive design system built specifically for financial services applications, combining Material Design principles with Your Town Finance's brand identity and accessibility standards.

### Educational Focus
Integrated financial literacy features help customers make informed decisions through contextual tooltips and educational content.
